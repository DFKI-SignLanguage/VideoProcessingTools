Calculates the 'motion energy' of the input frame sequence. The motion energy
is a mono-dimensional curve. Each sample is calculated by first computing the
optical flow between consecutive frames and then summing up the magnitude of
each flow vector. The resulting motion curve contains one frame less than the
input sequences. The output curve is a mono-dimensional numpy array.
Optionally, a debug video can be generated, with color associated to the
motion direction and motion magnitude mapped to color intensity.

  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --invideo INVIDEO, -i INVIDEO
                        Input video.
  --outmotioncurve OUTMOTIONCURVE, -o OUTMOTIONCURVE
                        Path to the output motion energy data.
  --normalize           If specified, normalizes the energy curve in the range
                        [0,1] before saving it.
  --frame-start FRAME_START
                        Start frame included in the motion energy computation
                        (default 0: first frame).
  --frame-end FRAME_END
                        End frame (excluded) in the motion energy computation
                        (default: last frame of the video).
  --output-video OUTPUT_VIDEO, -ov OUTPUT_VIDEO
                        Video output of the file.
